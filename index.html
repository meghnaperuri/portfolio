    <h2 class="headings">Experience</h2>
    <p>Embarking on my journey in the tech world, each step has been an exhilarating mix of challenges and triumphs. As
        a Computer Science Master’s student at George Mason University, I've had the opportunity to dive into diverse
        roles that have shaped my perspective and skills. At Corp Ten International in Virginia, I played a pivotal role
        in enhancing the UCAP 2.1 project, where I used my coding skills to transform user interfaces and significantly
        improve application performance. It was more than just programming; it was about crafting an engaging and
        efficient user experience.

        My stint at Adecco India Pvt Ltd as a Data Analyst Intern was a deep dive into the world of NLP, where I got to
        blend my analytical skills with my curiosity for cybersecurity. This wasn’t just a job; it was a mission to
        strengthen digital safety. Each dataset told a story, and I learned to listen and interpret, helping make
        informed strategic decisions.

        However, my time at Primark Infotech as a Software Engineer Intern was where I truly broadened my horizon. Here,
        I got to lead a team, developing and implementing software solutions with technologies like Python, JavaScript,
        and React.js. It was more than just developing software; it was about leading and learning, troubleshooting, and
        innovating.

        At JNTUH, India, I added another feather to my cap by working on cybersecurity, creating an innovative image
        authentication feature. It felt like a step into a futuristic world, where technology was not just a tool but a
        guardian.

        Each experience has been a building block in my career, not just enhancing my technical expertise but also
        nurturing my passion for making a meaningful impact through technology. Let's connect and explore the incredible
        possibilities of tech together!

    <h2 class="headings">Projects</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
        In my academic and professional journey, I've embraced diverse projects, each unique in its challenges and
        impact. Starting with the Image Captioning project for Autistic and Down syndrome children, I led a team to
        design a tool that revolutionized learning for these special learners. Collaborating with psychologists, we
        tailored the tool using TensorFlow and Keras, making education more engaging and accessible. Another venture,
        the Predictive Analytics for Patient Readmission, had me exploring the depths of healthcare data. Using the
        ARIMA model, this project was more than just number crunching; it was a step towards transformative healthcare
        management, aiming to predict patient readmission rates with unprecedented accuracy.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">
        On another front, ArtiFi - Artifacts Infinite on the Internet Computer - marked my foray into the dynamic world
        of blockchain and digital art. Building an NFT marketplace on the ICP, using Web3.js and Motoko, was not only a
        deep dive into decentralized trading but also an exploration of creativity in the digital space. This project
        was complemented by the UI Code Companion, a central web application aimed at streamlining code search and
        integration for developers. Using Python with Flask for the backend and Angular with HTML/CSS for the frontend,
        this project was a testament to my commitment to creating tools that simplify and enhance the developer
        experience.

<div class="experience">
    <h2 class="headings">Technical Skills</h2>
    <p>In my tech toolkit, you'll find a rich array of skills spanning multiple domains. I'm fluent in programming
        languages including Python, Java, C, and SQL, and have a strong command over front-end technologies like HTML 5,
        CSS 3, JavaScript ES6, React.js, and Vue3.js. My back-end development is bolstered by experience in Node.js and
        Express.js, coupled with database expertise in MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. My proficiency extends to data
        science and machine learning, where I skillfully use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras. In
        addition to these, I'm well-versed in cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure, and adept at tools like Git,
        GitHub, and Jupyter, ensuring a holistic approach to software development and data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve earned hands-on certifications in Full Stack Development and Oracle Academy's Artificial Intelligence with Machine Learning,
        and I've also dived into the entrepreneurial side with a certification from T-tribe. Plus, I took on the 100
        Days of Code challenge, sharpening my Python skills day by day.
